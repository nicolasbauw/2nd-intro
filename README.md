# My second Amiga (hardware learning) intro

This repo is an exhumation of an Amiga intro I coded in 2012, when I was learning Amiga hardware (I already knew assembly language).
Not the most beautiful code nor design, but at that time I reached my goal : use the copper, the blitter, DMA, interrupts, replay a module...

Works on ECS / KS 2.0 (not tried other configs). Assembled with AsmPro.
